This is a Java reimplementation of the Pygments syntax highlighter. Its lexers are generated automatically from Pygments lexer files. It can handle any lexer that is implemented using regular expressions (i.e. that is based on Pygments' RegexLexer class); languages that require custom programmatic parsing are not supported (but could be ported manually).

Supported languages include: C, C++, CSS, Go, Haskell, HTML, Java, Javascript, Objective C, Perl, Python (2 and 3), Scala, and XML.
